         *               It will not be used as a sync queue node

         *               nothing to do with the other uses of the
         *               field, but simplifies mechanics.)
         *   PROPAGATE:  A releaseShared should be propagated to other
         *               nodes. This is set (for head node only) in

         *
         * The values are arranged numerically to simplify use.
         * Non-negative values mean that a node doesn't need to

         * values, just for sign.
